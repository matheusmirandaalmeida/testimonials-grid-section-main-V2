          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
          every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
          it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
          the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
          course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
          of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
          entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
          way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
          during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
          multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
